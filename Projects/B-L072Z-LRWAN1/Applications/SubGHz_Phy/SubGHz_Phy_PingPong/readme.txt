@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a Ping-Pong application
between two PingPong Devices.

The PingPong Device can be
   - either a STM32LXxx-Nucleo board and Lora Radio expansion board, optionnally a sensor board.
   - or a B-L072Z-LRWAN1 board
It is a simple RX/TX RF link between the two PingPong Devices, one will be called Ping the other will be called Pong.
By default, each PingPong Device starts as a master and will transmit a "Ping" message, and then wait for an answer.
The first PingPong Device receiving a "Ping" message will become a slave and answers the master with a "Pong" message.
The Ping Pong is then started.
It means that both boards have their RX windows synchronised (and TX windows too). The RX window of the first board
should NOT be perfectly synchronised with the second board, there should be one TX window in front of one RX window.
You only have to reset one of the two boards, to get rid of this issue.

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Do the same for second board
  - Reset the two boards
  - Run the example on two boards
  - Open two Terminals, each connected to their respective PingPong Device
  - UART Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control
